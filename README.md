Description of Project:
Play as well known vocaloid "Miku", to spread her songs to all her sad fans who need cheering up. By spreading her songs she can win by helping 16 people become happy.

Instructions for use:
Keyboard and Mouse. WASD to move. Left click to shoot.

How it works:
Player character shoots bullets at enemies who follow you when they enter the Area2D around the characters. When the bullet enters the enemies collider a particle system is called and the enemy sprite turns from sad to happy and is counted as a point on the Label. Reach 16 points and you win, lose if enemy enters collider.

What I am most proud of: 
I am most proud of the art in the game, I enjoy making pixel art and it was fun to implement!

What I learned:
A valuable lesson I learned is how to use partical effects in Godot and the importance of masking layers to sort each element you have on the screen and how they interact with each other.
