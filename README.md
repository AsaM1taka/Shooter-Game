What I am most proud of: 
I am most proud of the art in the game, I enjoy making pixel art and it was fun to implement

What I learned:
A valuable lesson I learned is how to use partical effects in Godot and the importance of masking layers to sort each element you have on the screen and how they interact with each other.
